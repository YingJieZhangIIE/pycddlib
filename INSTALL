Automatic Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to install pycddlib, is to `download <http://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pycddlib/downloads/>`_ an installer and run it.

Building From Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get the source code, clone it with `Git <http://git-scm.com>`_ by running::

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pycddlib

You can also browse the source code on GitHub: `mcmtroffaes/pycddlib <http://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pycddlib>`_.

Then simply run the :file:`build.sh` script: this will build the library, install it, generate the documentation, and run all the doctests. Note that you need `Cython <http://www.cython.org/>`_ to compile the source, and `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to generate the documentation.

If you merely want to compile and install the library, just run::

    python setup.py install
