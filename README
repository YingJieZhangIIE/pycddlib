pycddlib is a Python wrapper for Komei Fukuda's cddlib, and is available
under a GPL license (see COPYING for more details).

Installation
============

The easiest option is to install a precompiled binary.

To compile and install pycddlib from the source code, make sure you have the
Pyrex module. If you don't have it, get it from

http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/

Then simply run

python setup.py install

and the code should compile and install.
